Scripts that are used to perform analysis of k-seek data. Raw data output from k-seek is too large for github, but easily reproducible by following k-seek manual and applying to 1KGP fastqs.


## Scripts

* interspersion.py: Script contains algorithm for counting interspersed satellites based on the read-pair output from k-seek.
* normKseek.py: Describes the algorithm used for normalizing raw k-mer counts data by GC and read depth using a GC bin table.
